# Classification_model_for_loan_repayment_prediction

* In this notebook we will try to practice the classification algorithms to determine the **best classifier to predict the loan repayment status**.

* This dataset is about past loans. The Loan_train.csv data set includes details of 346 customers whose loan are already paid off or defaulted. 

* Our problem require to predict the category of the client in the form of loan status which is also our Target variable therefore we will apply classfication predicting   algorithm for our purpose.

* We load a dataset using Pandas library, and apply the various classifications algorithms, and find the best one for this specific dataset by accuracy evaluation methods.
